## Problem Description

You are tasked with designing a distributed cache system to improve the performance and reduce the impact on rate limiting when querying GitHub and GitLab data through a GraphQL backend of our platform. The goal is to efficiently store and retrieve data from GitHub and GitLab while ensuring data privacy, consistency, and synchronization across a distributed environment.

## Assignment

Your task is to whiteboard the design of a distributed cache system that can effectively store and manage GitHub and GitLab data. Consider the following aspects in your design:

1. **Cache Storage Technology**:
   - Choose a suitable caching technology (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for storing GitHub and GitLab data in our conceptual product backend.
   - Explain why you selected this technology and its advantages for this use case.

2. **Cache Data Structure**:
   - Define the structure of data to be stored in the cache.
   - Consider how to represent GitHub and GitLab data (e.g., repositories, commits) in the cache.

3. **Cache Eviction Policies**:
   - Design cache eviction policies to manage data expiration and eviction.
   - Explain how you would handle scenarios where data becomes stale or needs to be removed from the cache.

4. **Distributed Synchronization**:
   - Describe how the cache system will handle synchronization in a distributed environment.
   - Consider scenarios where multiple cache nodes need to be coordinated to maintain consistency.

5. **Data Privacy and Security**:
   - Address data privacy concerns and ensure that sensitive information is not exposed in the cache.
   - Discuss any security measures or access controls in place to protect cached data.

6. **Data Consistency**:
   - Explain how the cache system will maintain data consistency between the cache and the source (GitHub and GitLab).
   - Consider strategies for cache invalidation when the source data changes.

7. **Cache Size and Scalability**:
   - Discuss how the cache system will handle different cache sizes and scalability requirements.
   - Consider load balancing and adding cache nodes to meet growing demands.

8. **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**:
   - Outline strategies for ensuring high availability and fault tolerance in the cache system.
   - Describe how the system will handle node failures or network issues.

## Submission

Your solution can be a whiteboard diagram or a written description of your cache system design, addressing all the key aspects mentioned above. If you use a whiteboard diagram, please provide annotations and explanations as needed.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Completeness and correctness of the cache system design.
- Consideration of cache technology, data structure, and eviction policies.
- Handling of distributed synchronization and data privacy.
- Strategies for ensuring data consistency and cache scalability.
- Measures for high availability and fault tolerance.

**Note:** This assignment assesses your system design skills, particularly in the context of caching and distributed systems. The goal is to create a robust and efficient cache system that enhances the performance of the GraphQL backend while addressing important considerations like data privacy and consistency. Good luck with the assignment!
