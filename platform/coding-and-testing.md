## Problem Description

You are tasked with solving the classic programming problem known as "FizzBuzz." Your goal is to write a program in your language of choice (but we love Go or TypeScript!) that prints integers from 1 to N. However, there is a twist:

- If an integer is divisible by three, print "Fizz."
- If an integer is divisible by five, print "Buzz."
- If an integer is divisible by both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."

Additionally, to demonstrate your test automation skills, please write tests for your FizzBuzz solution.

## Assignment

1. Write a program in your chosen language that solves the FizzBuzz problem. You should be able to take an input `N` (an integer) and print the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to N.

2. Implement the logic to determine whether a number is divisible by three, five, or both.

3. Write tests for your FizzBuzz solution to verify its correctness. You can use a testing framework appropriate for your chosen language (e.g., Go's testing package or a JavaScript/TypeScript testing library like jest).

4. Ensure that your code is clean, well-structured, and easy to understand. Follow best coding practices.

## Submission

You can submit your solution in a code snippet, a code repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), or any format you prefer. Include instructions on how to run your program and tests.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness: Does your FizzBuzz program produce the expected output for a given input N?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, clean, and easy to understand?
- Testing: Do you have comprehensive tests to verify the correctness of your solution?
- Logic: Does your program correctly identify numbers divisible by three, five, or both?

**Bonus Points:**

- Demonstrating strong test automation skills by providing thorough test coverage.
- Writing elegant and efficient code that follows best practices in your chosen language.

**Note:** You have the flexibility to choose the programming language of your preference (but we use Go and Typescript the most here). The emphasis is on solving the FizzBuzz problem and demonstrating your ability to write meaningful tests, how your approach it and how you talk about it. Good luck with the assignment!
